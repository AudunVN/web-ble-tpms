# web-ble-tpms

Quick proof-of-concept Web BLE data reader for a seemingly fairly common bluetooth-based tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS). It comes with sensors labeled with six-digit hexadecimal IDs that you (usually) have to manually put into an app of some kind to read the BLE advertisement data that these broadcast every now and then.
